# Getting Started with SQLite

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is a open-source, embedded database. Its simplistic nature makes it a great candiate for prototyping and testing.

You can use SQLite with Vapor (or any server-side Swift framework) by either:

- Using [Fluent SQLite](fluent.md) ORM.
- Use just [SQLite core](core.md).

We recommend using the ORM since it does a lot of the hard work for you. Check out the respective guides to learn more.
