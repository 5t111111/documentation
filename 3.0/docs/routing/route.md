# Route

Route is an object that contains the essential information of an HTTP Route.

It contains the route's Method, path components and responder.

## Extensions

Route is [`Extendable`](../core/extend.md), meaning you can extend it's properties.

The purpose is to allow documentation tools to hook into the Vapor routing process.
