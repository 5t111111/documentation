# Getting Started with PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a powerful, open-source database that puts an emphasis on standards compliance. PostgreSQL's strong type-system make it a great fit with Swift, and it is the preferred database for use with Vapor.

You can use PostgreSQL with Vapor (or any server-side Swift framework) by either:

- Using [Fluent PostgreSQL](fluent.md) ORM.
- Use just [PostgreSQL core](core.md).

We recommend using the ORM since it does a lot of the hard work for you. Check out the respective guides to learn more.
