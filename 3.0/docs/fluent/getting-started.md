# Getting Started with Fluent

Fluent ([vapor/fluent](https://github.com/vapor/fluent)) is a type-safe, fast, and easy-to-use ORM framework built for Swift.
It takes advantage of Swift's strong type system to provide an elegant foundation for building database integrations.

## Database

Fluent is just a framework for building ORMs, not an ORM itself. To get started using Fluent, pick one of the databases below.

|database  |library         |driver                 |guide                                               |
|----------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------- |
|PostgreSQL|vapor/postgresql|vapor/fluent-postgresql|[Getting Started &rarr;](../postgresql/fluent.md)   |
|MySQL     |vapor/mysql     |vapor/fluent-mysql     |[Getting Started &rarr;](../mysql/fluent.md)  |
|SQLite    |vapor/sqlite    |vapor/fluent-sqlite    |[Getting Started &rarr;](../sqlite/fluent.md) |

After you get started, come back to the other sections in this guide for a more in-depth look at Fluent's features.
